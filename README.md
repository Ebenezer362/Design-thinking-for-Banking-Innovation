# Design-thinking-for-Banking-Innovation

**Project Overview**

This project applies Design Thinking to address a critical challenge in the banking sector:
How might we create a better way for bank customers to understand their financial position?
Last year(2024) I had the opportunity to undertake design thinking project with IiAfrica, this research project explores financial literacy gaps, banking habits, and user challenges, leading to the design of a user-centric digital banking solution.

**🎯 Objectives**

✔️ Identify financial literacy barriers among bank customers.

✔️ Understand customer behavior and digital banking preferences.

✔️ Develop an interactive financial dashboard to improve financial awareness.

✔️ Propose a human-centered banking solution based on research insights.

**📌 Key Insights from Research**

📊 72% of respondents struggle with financial literacy.

📊 Internet banking is the most preferred method, but network issues remain a major challenge.

📊 Users seek better banking experiences, especially in service reliability and accessibility.

**💡 Proposed Solution – eTC Application**

Based on Design Thinking principles, we developed eTC, a user-friendly digital banking solution.

**🔹 Key Features:**

✅ Unified Banking: Manage multiple bank accounts in one place.

✅ Smart Financial Dashboard: Real-time financial insights & tracking.

✅ AI-Powered Assistance: A virtual assistant in local languages.

✅ Budget & Investment Advisor: Personalized financial guidance.

✅ Enhanced Security: End-to-end encryption and fraud detection.
